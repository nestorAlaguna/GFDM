ðŸ“¡ EE45GS 5G Modulation Analysis: GFDM vs. OFDM

Project for the Erasmus Mundus SMARNET Program at Aston University (2020â€“2021)
Objective: Design, analyze, and compare GFDM (Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing) and OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) for 5G systems, evaluating trade-offs in spectral efficiency, complexity, and energy efficiency.
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Key Tasks:

    Algorithm Development:

        Implemented user-friendly signal processing algorithms (Python/MATLAB) to generate GFDM/OFDM signals with customizable parameters.

        Integrated quantitative metrics: BER (Bit Error Rate), SER (Symbol Error Rate), and Q-factor.

        Output visualizations: Spectrum plots, eye diagrams, and constellation diagrams.

    Complexity Optimization:

        Minimized computational complexity while maintaining spectral efficiency.

        Analyzed design choices impacting 5G system performance.

    User Manual:

        Created detailed documentation covering:

            System components and algorithmic representation.

            Parameter guidelines and known limitations.
